<h1>Recipe for Oreo Cheese Cake</h1>

<h3>Equipment</h3>
<ol>
    <li>spring form pan</li>
    <li>electric mixer</li>
    <li>mixing pan</li>
</ol>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>35 Oreo cookies</li>
    <li>5 Tablespoons unsalted butter melted</li>
    <li>32 oz cream cheese softened</li>
    <li>¾ cup sour cream </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
    <li>3 oz chocolate use semisweet chocolate chips or a finely chopped semisweet baking bar</li>
    <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
</ul>
<h3> Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 325F (160C).
        Twist apart the 35 Oreo cookies, use a butter knife to scrape out the filling (discard the filling)
        and toss cookies into the basin of a food processor.
        Pulse until cookies are ground into fine crumbs.
        Combine cookie crumbs and melted butter in a large bowl and toss together until all crumbs are moistened.
        Press crumbs evenly into the bottom and up the sides of 9” springform pan (go as high up the pan as you can, this will help prevent cracks!).
        I like to use a glass to help with this. Set aside while you prepare cheesecake filling (you do not need to bake the crust on its own)</li>

    <li>Place 15 Oreo cookies in a large Ziploc bag and use a rolling pin to smack them repeatedly until cookies are broken up into coarse pieces (don’t break too small or grind too fine you want substantial cookie pieces in your cheesecake!). Set aside.
        In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, combine cream cheese and sugar. Use an electric mixer (or stand mixer) to beat on medium-low speed until cream cheese and sugar are completely combined and no lumps remain (scrape sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure no lumps).
        With mixer on low-speed, stir in sour cream and vanilla extract until completely combined and batter is smooth.
        Add eggs one at a time, stirring until just-combined after each addition (eggs should be well combined, but don’t overbeat or the texture of the cheesecake could be affected). Scrape sides and bottom of bowl to ensure all ingredients are well incorporated.
        Use a spatula to fold in Oreo pieces.
        Pour batter into prepared springform pan and use a spatula to smooth the surface.
        Place cheesecake on a foil lined baking sheet and transfer to the center rack of 325F (160C) oven and bake for 50-60 minutes. Center should be set but spring back lightly to the touch and if jostled the center will slightly jiggle like set jello but should not be liquidy. The very edges of the cheesecake may be turning a very faint brown or very slightly cracking when the cheesecake is finished.
        Remove cheesecake from oven and if any of the cheesecake filling is touching the springform pan and isn’t enclosed by the crust, use a sharp knife to gently loosen it (this will prevent cracks as the cheesecake settles). Allow cheesecake to cool for about an hour at room temperature, then transfer to refrigerator to chill for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
    <li>Once cheesecake is set, prepare ganache. Place chocolate in a heatproof bowl and set aside.
        Pour cream into a small saucepan and heat over medium heat until it just begins to simmer. Immediately drizzle over chocolate, cover bowl with foil, and let sit for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, gently stir with a whisk until chocolate is completely melted and ganache is smooth.
        Drizzle ganache evenly over cheesecake.
        Return cheesecake to refrigerator and allow ganache to set before slicing and serving (about 20 minutes). If desired, pipe half a batch of homemade whipped cream over top of firm ganache cheesecake before serving (I piped the whipped cream on top of my cheesecake using an Ateco 848 tip).</li>
